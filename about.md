I'm a recent graduate of Yale University, where I studied Mathematics and Economics, with a healthy smattering of Statistics and zero Computer Science.

A couple of months ago, I began studying deep learning and found that, for the first time in since graduating, I wanted to keep a lab notebook of all of my thoughts.  The purpose of this site is to do just that, and to hopefully be readable by anyone with who has taken introductory calculus.
